someone had passed that perilous way before us. From amid a tuft of
cotton grass which bore it up out of the slime some dark thing was
projecting. Holmes sank to his waist as he stepped from the path to
seize it, and had we not been there to drag him out he could never have
set his foot upon firm land again. He held an old black boot in the
air. "Meyers, Toronto," was printed on the leather inside. 

"It is worth a mud bath," said he. "It is our friend Sir Henry's
missing boot." 

"Thrown there by Stapleton in his flight." 

"Exactly. He retained it in his hand after using it to set the hound
upon the track. He fled when he knew the game was up, still clutching
it. And he hurled it away at this point of his flight. We know at least
that he came so far in safety." 

But more than that we were never destined to know, though there was
much which we might surmise. There was no chance of finding footsteps
in the mire, for the rising mud oozed swiftly in upon them, but as we
at last reached firmer ground beyond the morass we all looked eagerly
for them. But no slightest sign of them ever met our eyes. If the earth
told a true story, then Stapleton never reached that island of refuge
towards which he struggled through the fog upon that last night.
Somewhere in the heart of the great Grimpen Mire, down in the foul
slime of the huge morass which had sucked him in, this cold and
cruel-hearted man is forever buried. 

Many traces we found of him in the bog-girt island where he had hid his
savage ally. A huge driving-wheel and a shaft half-filled with rubbish
showed the position of an abandoned mine. Beside it were the crumbling
remains of the cottages of the miners, driven away no doubt by the foul
reek of the surrounding swamp. In one of these a staple and chain with
a quantity of gnawed bones showed where the animal had been confined. A
skeleton with a tangle of brown hair adhering to it lay among the
debris. 

"A dog!" said Holmes. "By Jove, a curly-haired spaniel. Poor Mortimer
will never see his pet again. Well, I do not know that this place
contains any secret which we have not already fathomed. He could hide
his hound, but he could not hush its voice, and hence came those cries
which even in daylight were not pleasant to hear. On an emergency he
could keep the hound in the out-house at Merripit, but it was always a
risk, and it was only on the supreme day, which he regarded as the end
of all his efforts, that he dared do it. This paste in the tin is no
doubt the luminous mixture with which the creature was daubed. It was
suggested, of course, by the story of the family hell-hound, and by the
desire to frighten old Sir Charles to death. No wonder the poor devil
of a convict ran and screamed, even as our friend did, and as we
ourselves might have done, when he saw such a creature bounding through
the darkness of the moor upon his track. It was a cunning device, for,
apart from the chance of driving your victim to his death, what peasant
would venture to inquire too closely into such a creature should he get
sight of it, as many have done, upon the moor? I said it in London,
Watson, and I say it again now, that never yet have we helped to hunt
down a more dangerous man than he who is lying yonder" -- he swept his
long arm towards the huge mottled expanse of green-splotched bog which
stretched away until it merged into the russet slopes of the moor.

"Then I answer, certainly not." 

"Not on the very day of Sir Charles's death?" 

The flush had faded in an instant, and a deathly face was before me.
Her dry lips could not speak the "No" which I saw rather than heard. 

"Surely your memory deceives you," said I. "I could even quote a
passage of your letter. It ran "Please, please, as you are a gentleman,

I thought that she had fainted, but she recovered herself by a supreme

"That is the truth." 

Again and again I cross-questioned her, but I could never get past that

"Mrs. Lyons," said I as I rose from this long and inconclusive
interview, "you are taking a very great responsibility and putting

The Hound of the Baskervilles.

                          Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who was usually very late in the mornings, save
upon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all night, was
seated at the breakfast table. I stood upon the hearth-rug and picked
up the stick which our visitor had left behind him the night before. It
was a fine, thick piece of wood, bulbous-headed, of the sort which is
known as a "Penang lawyer." Just under the head was a broad silver band
nearly an inch across. "To James Mortimer, M.R.C.S., from his friends
of the C.C.H.," was engraved upon it, with the date "1884." It was just
such a stick as the old-fashioned family practitioner used to carry --
dignified, solid, and reassuring. 

"Well, Watson, what do you make of it?" 

Holmes was sitting with his back to me, and I had given him no sign of
my occupation. 

"How did you know what I was doing? I believe you have eyes in the back
of your head." 

"I have, at least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot in front
of me," said he. "But, tell me, Watson, what do you make of our
visitor's stick? Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss him and
have no notion of his errand, this accidental souvenir becomes of
importance. Let me hear you reconstruct the man by an examination of
it." 

"I think," said I, following as far as I could the methods of my
companion, "that Dr. Mortimer is a successful, elderly medical man,
well-esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of their
appreciation." 

"Good!" said Holmes. "Excellent!" 

"I think also that the probability is in favour of his being a country
practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on foot." 

"Why so?" 

"Because this stick, though originally a very handsome one has been so
knocked about that I can hardly imagine a town practitioner carrying
it. The thick-iron ferrule is worn down, so it is evident that he has
done a great amount of walking with it." 

"Perfectly sound!" said Holmes. 

"And then again, there is the "friends of the C.C.H." I should guess
that to be the Something Hunt, the local hunt to whose members he has
possibly given some surgical assistance, and which has made him a small
presentation in return." 

"Really, Watson, you excel yourself," said Holmes, pushing back his
chair and lighting a cigarette. "I am bound to say that in all the
accounts which you have been so good as to give of my own small
achievements you have habitually underrated your own abilities. It may

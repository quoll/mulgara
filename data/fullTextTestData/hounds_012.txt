Dr. Mortimer looked strangely at us for an instant, and his voice sank
almost to a whisper as he answered: 

"Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound!" 

        =======================================================

                              The Problem.

I confess at these words a shudder passed through me. There was a
thrill in the doctor's voice which showed that he was himself deeply
moved by that which he told us. Holmes leaned forward in his excitement
and his eyes had the hard, dry glitter which shot from them when he was
keenly interested. 

"You saw this?" 

"As clearly as I see you." 

"And you said nothing?" 

"What was the use?" 

"How was it that no one else saw it?" 

"The marks were some twenty yards from the body and no one gave them a
thought. I don't suppose I should have done so had I not known this
legend." 

"There are many sheep-dogs on the moor?" 

"No doubt, but this was no sheep-dog." 

"You say it was large?" 

"Enormous." 

"But it had not approached the body?" 

"No." 

"What sort of night was it? ' 

" Damp and raw. "

"But not actually raining?" 

"No." 

"What is the alley like?" 

"There are two lines of old yew hedge, twelve feet high and 

impenetrable. The walk in the centre is about eight feet across. "

"Is there anything between the hedges and the walk?" 

"Yes, there is a strip of grass about six feet broad on either side." 

"I understand that the yew hedge is penetrated at one point by a gate?"

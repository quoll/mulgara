XML utilities.
</h1>
<p>
This package allows DTDs to be stored as resources in the classpath.
The DTDs are currently hardcoded in, and include XHTML and Log4J.
They're more fully described in
{@link org.mulgara.xml.ResourceEntityResolver}.
</p>
<p>
There's no logging in this package.  The reason for this is that one of its
uses is to intercept Log4J from fetching the DTD for its configuration file
from the Apache site.  Using any Log4J functions would initialize Log4J
before the document builder factory was installed.
</p>
<p>
This package is dependent on Crimson, the default parser in Sun's JDK 1.4.
The class <code>org.apache.crimson.jaxp.DocumentBuilderFactoryImpl</code>
must be in the classpath.

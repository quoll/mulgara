<h2>Introduction</h2>
 Descriptors are composed of several components:<br>
 
<ul>
   <li>Extensions to XSL&nbsp;</li>
   
  <ul>
     <li>query tag enables Mulgara iTQL queries to be performed in XSL stylesheets</li>
     <li>descriptor tag enables one descriptor to call another</li>
   
  </ul>
   <li>Java Objects which invoke descriptors and return their results</li>
   <li>Java Servlets which invoke descriptors using HTTP</li>
   <li>SOAP endpoints which enable all descriptors to be accessable as a
SOAP service.</li>
 
</ul>
 A Descriptor is therefore an XSL stylesheet that performs a specific, well 
defined task. &nbsp;Useful tasks include<br>
 
<ul>
   <li>Hide complex Mulgara queries behind a simple interface</li>
   <li>Complex data can be aggregated by descriptors calling other descriptors</li>
   <li>HTML front ends to Mulgara queries can be rapidy developed</li>
   <li>Descriptors are fast, not much slower than working with the API directly.<br>
   </li>
 
</ul>
 Advantages to working with descriptors over using an API include<br>
 
<ul>
   <li>Defining an interface for client while allowing the implementation 
to evolve, even at runtime (live development)</li>
   <li>Descriptors are referenced as URLs, so Mulgara servers may use descriptors 
from remote machines.</li>
   <li>Descriptor interfaces are well defined in RDF so humans or applications 
can discover descriptors that meet their needs.</li>
   <li>Descriptors are SOAP accessable and are therefore usable from other 
languages and platforms such as .NET, VB, Perl etc.<br>
   </li>
 
</ul>
 Disadvantages when <i>Developing</i> Descriptors are:  
<ul>
   <li>Knowledge of XSL required</li>
   <li>Debugging may be tricky when using deeply embedded descriptors due 
to layers of components involved.</li>
   <li>When working with large XML results memory and/or CPU requirements 
will be higher than using the API directly.</li>
 
</ul>
 Disadvantages when <i>Using</i> Descriptors are:<br>
 
<ul>
   <li>Parameters may currently only be strings, this may change in future 
to support complex types</li>
   <li>No session type functionality when developing HTML web apps (unless 
used from application server)</li>
   <li>Descriptors do currently not declare their capabilties in a machine 
understandable manner, in future versions this will be rectified.</li>
   <li>NO DTD or Schema is defined for the data returned, Developer needs 
to 'eyeball' the structure. &nbsp;This will be changed in a future version 
of descriptors.<br>
   </li>
 
</ul>

<h2>Namespaces<br>
 </h2>
 <b>NOTE</b> all tags must be in a certain namespace in order to be recognized 
as XSL extensions, when using descriptors created by the descriptor Wizard 
a prefix of mulgaraDescriptor such be used e.g.<br>
 <br>
 &lt;mulgaraDescriptor:query&gt;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; perform Mulgara Query<br>
 &lt;/mulgaraDescriptor:query&gt;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 &lt;mulgaraDescriptor:descriptor<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; call Mulgara Descriptor<br>
 /&gt;<br>
 <br>
 The documentation below leaves out these name spaces for clarity. 
<h2>XSL query Tag</h2>
 The query tag is an extension to XSL that enables Mulgara queries to be made
from an XSL stylesheet. &nbsp;<br>
  <br>
 &lt;query&gt;<br>
 &lt;!CDATA[[<br>
 select $person from &lt;rmi://host/server1#people&gt; where $person &lt;http://foo#hasName&gt; 
'James Gosling';<br>
 ]]&gt;<br>
 &lt;/query&gt;<br>
 <br>
 The result of a query is XML with the answer to the query, if any. &nbsp;Answers 
are normally transformed into something more suitable for the client or into 
a presentation format such as HTML or PDF. &nbsp; Other descriptors make calls
on a descriptor to perform a task without needing to know how that task is
performed, e.g. return the title of a document in between 2 &lt;title&gt; 
tags.<br>
 <br>
 Most queries will need some parameters in order to make the queries reusable 
across servers and models, e.g. most will take the model as a parameter. &nbsp;The
model parameter can simply be inserted in several ways as specified in the
XSL specification, however because the query is in a CDATA segment breaking
out of it makes the query not easily human readable e.g.<br>
 <br>
 &lt;query&gt;<br>
 &lt;!CDATA[[<br>
  select $person from &lt;]]&gt;&lt;xsl:variable select="$model"/&gt;&lt;!CDATA[[&gt; 
where $person &lt;http://foo#hasName&gt; 'James Gosling';<br>
  ]]&gt;<br>
 &lt;/query&gt;<br>
 <br>
 The query tag has a workaround to avoid having to do this. &nbsp;If any
string in the CDATA section is surrounded by @@ symbols then the string is
replaced with the value of an attribute of the same name in the query tag,
this is best explained by an example:<br>
 <br>
 &lt;query model="rmi://host/server1#people"&gt;<br>
  &lt;!CDATA[[<br>
  select $person from &lt;@@model@@&gt; where $person &lt;http://foo#hasName&gt; 
'James Gosling';<br>
  ]]&gt;<br>
  &lt;/query&gt;<br>
 <br>
 When the descriptor is executing this element it substitutes rmi://host/server1# 
for @@model@@ before passing the query to Mulgara. &nbsp;By specifing the parameter 
as an Descriptor parameter the value can be passed in by the client e.g.<br>
 <br>
 &lt;query model="{$model}"&gt;<br>
   &lt;!CDATA[[<br>
   select $person from &lt;@@model@@&gt; where $person &lt;http://foo#hasName&gt; 
'James Gosling';<br>
   ]]&gt;<br>
   &lt;/query&gt;<br>
 <br>
 If the descriptor was created with a model parameter defined as a string 
this query is now portable across models. &nbsp;The substitution is unrestricted 
i.e. it is not limited to models, any string can be substituted.<br>
 
<h2>XSL descriptor Tag </h2>
 The descriptor tag is an extension to XSL that enables a descriptor (i.e. 
XSL stylesheet) to call another descriptor and operate on the output of the 
called descriptor. &nbsp;This effectively allows subtasking or delegation 
of tasks to other descriptors whose implementations may evolve over time.<br>
 <br>
 &lt;descriptor _target="http://foo/descriptors/extractPeopleAsHtml.xsl"
/&gt;<br>
 <br>
 The above tag executes the descriptor located at http://foo/descriptors/extractPeopleAsHtml.xsl 
and returns the output into the output stream of the XSL transformer i.e. 
it as if the result of the called (target) descriptor was part of the source 
descriptor.<br>
 <br>
 <b>NOTE</b> any attributes being with an underscore '_' are reserved and 
are internal to the descriptor. &nbsp;<br>
 <br>
 The attribute _target specifies the descriptor to invoke, if the descriptors 
full URL is NOT known but its relative URL is known then a relative URL can 
be used if the source URL of the source descriptor is included as a _source 
attribute, e.g.<br>
 <br>
 &lt;descriptor _target="extractPeopleAsHtml.xsl"&nbsp; _source="http://foo/descriptors/extractPeopleAndCompaniesAsHTML.xsl" 
/&gt;<br>
 <br>
 This allows the descriptor code to build a complete URL for the target descriptor, 
however since descriptors do NOT know their URL until invoked (i.e. they are
told) the tag above is more often used in the form below.<br>
 <br>
 &lt;descriptor _target="extractPeopleAsHtml.xsl"&nbsp; _source="{$_self}" 
/&gt;<br>
 <br>
 _self is a special parameter passed to all descriptors on invokation, it 
is set to the URL of the descriptor, this oddity is due to the fact that descriptors
have no URL until they are deployed, when they are deployed they assume the
URL they were loaded in as. &nbsp;Therefore the above descriptor will be
located as long as it is in the same directory as the calling (source descriptor).<br>
 <br>
 Descriptor parameters are specified as attributes on the descriptor tag, 
using our previous example where we extracted people from a model, where the
model had to be specifed the tag could look like this.<br>
 <br>
 &lt;descriptor _target="extractPeopleAsHtml.xsl"&nbsp; _source="{$_self}" 
model="{$model}"/&gt;<br>
 <br>
 If some attributes are long it is preferable to format the tag like this:<br>
 <br>
 &lt;descriptor <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _target="extractPeopleAsHtml.xsl"&nbsp; <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _source="{$_self}" <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; model="{$model}"/&gt;<br>
 <br>
 
<h2>Reserved Parameters<br>

 Several parameters have special meanings which may be different depending 
on the context (Element, XSL, HTTP/SOAP)<br>

 if set to any value as a HTTP parameter this causes all cached Descriptors 
to be cleared. &nbsp;This is useful to a developer when testing a descriptor.

they have changed unless the cache is cleared.<br>

<h2>FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions<br>
 </h2>
 Descriptors depend on a lot of disparate technologies therefore there is 
no single point of failure which can make debugging a descriptor frustrating 
unless you have knowledge over the underlying technologies (XSL, Servlets, 
SOAP). &nbsp;Some of the most common pitfalls and solutions are summarized 
here. 
<h3>How do I create a Descriptor ?</h3>
 Use the Descriptor wizard - available as a task from the <a href="../"
 target="descriptor">Descriptor Management</a> page. 
<h3>How do I execute an iTQL query ?</h3>
 There are 2 ways to execute an iTQL query:<br>
 <br>
 1) use the iTQL command line client<br>
 2) use the built in GUI <a href="../webui/" target="webui">Mulgara viewer</a> 
<h3>How do I deploy the built in Descriptors ?<br>
 </h3>
 Use one of the Deploy built in descriptors tasks from the <a
 href="file:///mnt/home/keith/work/mulgara/src/war/descriptor/"
 target="descriptor">Descriptor Management</a> page. &nbsp;There are 2 tasks 
available e to deploy the built in descriptors. &nbsp;One task completely 
removes all descriptors before redeploying the built in ones, while the other 
deploys the built in descriptors while preserving the exisiting descriptors 
- such as the ones you may have developed. 
<h3>How do I deploy my descriptor ?</h3>
    To use a descriptor it must be deployed in a Mulgara database. &nbsp;Deployment
  is simple, all that is required is that the RDF embedded in the descriptor
  XSL file is loaded into a model in a Mulgara database.<br>
    <br>
    Start an iTQL client TODO link.<br>
    <br>
    Check if the descriptor model already exists TODO link<br>
    <br>
    To deploy simply load the descriptor XSL file into this model:<br>
    <br>
    iTQL&gt; load &lt;file:/home/joe/work/helloworld.xsl&gt; into &lt;rmi://localhost/server1#descriptors&gt;;<br>
    <br>
 <b>   NOTE</b> the location of the descriptor MUST be readable to the Mulgara 
server.<br>
    <br>
    If the there were no errors in the XSL then the Descriptor is now deployed
  and available for use, if there were errors check your XML for bad syntax
  such as unclosed tags. &nbsp;The Descriptor wizard generates correct XML
 and XSL.<br>
 <b><br>
 NOTE </b>the EXACT URL used to load the descriptor is the URL you MUST use 
when invoking the descriptor from a client (SOAP, Java, descriptor). &nbsp;i.e. 
you can not load a descriptor using a file URL and then try and use if from 
a HTTP url - even if its on a web server, if it is to be used from a web server
then it should be loaded with a HTTP url after it has been put on the webserver
e.g. if the file above was on a web server under a work directory e.g. /home/joe/work/
is equivalent to http://foo/joe/work then the descriptor should be deployed
like this:<br>
 <br>
    iTQL&gt; load &lt;http:/foo//joe/work/helloworld.xsl&gt; into &lt;rmi://localhost/server1#descriptors&gt;;<br>
   <br>
 When descriptors are deployed as HTTP URL they are accessable by any clients 
with HTTP access, including anywhere on the internet if accessable through 
a firewall. 
<h3><b>I can't invoke my descriptor.</b></h3>
 First see if the descriptor model exists on the Mulgara server TODO link. &nbsp;If 
it does then check if your descriptor is deployed TODO link. &nbsp;If you 
have changed any of the parameters required, their types or anything else 
from you entered from the Descriptor Wizard then you will have to redeploy, 
the easiest way to do this is to redeploy the built in descriptors and redeploy 
your descriptor. 
<h3><b>How do I check if the descriptor model exists on a Mulgara server ?</b></h3>
 There are 2 ways to check if the descriptor model exists<br>
 <br>
 1) Use the lists descriptor task from the <a href="../">Descriptor Management 
</a>page, if it fails no descriptor model exists and the built in descriptor 
should be deployed TODO link<br>
 2) Use an iTQL query <br>
 <br>
 Execute this query (see *TODO* here for how to execute an iTQL query.)<br>
 <br>
  select $model from &lt;rmi://HOSTNAME/server1#&gt; where $model &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type&gt;
 &lt;http://tucana.org/tucana#Model&gt;;<br>
  <br>
  <b>NOTE</b> replace HOSTNAME with the fully qualified hostname of the Mulgara 
server e.g. foo.bar.com and not just foo.<br>
  <br>
  This query will return all models on the server, if there is no #descriptor 
model then you should deploy the built in descriptors and any descriptors 
you have developed. &nbsp; 
<h3><b>How do I check if my descriptor is deployed ?</b></h3>
 Descriptors must be deployed before use. &nbsp;The Mulgara code that invokes 
descriptors looks up the parameters a descriptor uses as well as other information 
before it invokes a descriptor, if the descriptor has not been deployed then 
the code &nbsp;does not know how to invoke it and will have errors. <br>
 <br>
 First make sure the built in descriptors are deployed TODO link, then select 
the See List of Descriptor on this host task from the <a href="../">Descriptor 
Management</a> page. 
<h3>What is the life cycle of a Descriptor ?</h3>
 When a descriptor is first invoked the descriptor code retrieves the descriptor 
from its URL and creates a java object representing that descriptor. &nbsp;The 
XSL transformer processes the XSL stylesheet into an internal form which only
happens once. &nbsp;This descriptor object is placed in a free pool for use,
when used it is placed &nbsp;in a busy pool until it has performed its duty,
then it is returned to the free pool. &nbsp;If a client requests a descriptor
and an instance is already in the busy pool and new instance is created and
made available, both descriptors will eventually return to the free pool.
&nbsp;Descriptors are NOT currently garbage collected, the pool grows to
the size needed and stays that size, it is not expected that these pools
will get very large - especially in comparison to resources in a Mulgara server.
&nbsp;This may change in future. &nbsp;There is a facility to purge all the
cached descriptors - see here TODO 
<h3>How do I empty the Descriptor Cache ?</h3>
 This task is available from the <a href="../">Descriptor Management</a>
page. 
<h3>I've changed my Descriptor XSL code but when invoked it does not notice 
my changes, whats wrong ?</h3>
 Descriptors are downloaded and processed into Java Objects which are cached 
and reused. &nbsp;If you have changed the logic in a descriptor but NOT the 
parameters, mime type etc. (i.e. everything specified in the Descriptor Wizard) 
then you need to clear the Descriptor cache. This task is available from the
<a href="file:///mnt/home/keith/work/mulgara/src/war/descriptor/">Descriptor Management</a>
page. &nbsp;If you have added or removed a parameter, mime type etc then
you will need to re deploy your descriptor TODO link.<br>
 <br>
 If the descriptor is on a web server have you published it to the web server?<br>
 
<h3>My Descriptor doesn't work, are errors logged anywhere ?<br>
 </h3>
 A file called descriptor-errors.log is created where Mulgara was started from, 
it will contain the reasons for Descriptors failing, it may also write out 
a stack trace for more detailed error explanations for example when the XML 
or XSL parser fails. &nbsp; 
<h3>Can't have more than one ROOT in a DOM ! Error&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>org.w3c.dom.DOMException: DOM006 Hierarchy request Error</h3>
This frequently happens when calling one descriptor from another. &nbsp;The 
descriptor being called is returning XML with more than one root, this is 
fine but if you try and store this in a variable or pass it to something expecting
a single root you will get this error e.g.<br>
 <br>
 Descriptor A returns<br>
 <br>
 &lt;price&gt;17.55&lt;/price&gt;<br>
 &lt;album&gt;Is This It&lt;/album&gt;<br>
 &lt;artist&gt;The Strokes&lt;/artist&gt; <br>
 <br>
 Descriptor B calls descriptor A and tries to store the result in a variable, 
it can not since the XML is not in a tree. &nbsp;Descriptor A should return 
something like:<br>
 <br>
 &lt;cd&gt;<br>
&lt;price&gt;17.55&lt;/price&gt;<br>
  &lt;album&gt;Is This It&lt;/album&gt;<br>
  &lt;artist&gt;The Strokes&lt;/artist&gt; <br>
 &lt;/cd&gt;<br>
 <br>
 The XML now has one root.<br>
 <br>
 Note that this can happen where there is some text after a node e.g.<br>
 <br>
 &lt;price&gt;17.55&lt;/price&gt;<br>
 The Strokes<br>
 <br>
 There is an invisible text node in the above example, it needs outer &lt;cd&gt; 
tags like the previous example. If the error is the DOM006 Hierarchy request
error then it usually means the calling descriptors needs to have tags around
the descriptor its calling e.g.<br>
<br>
Descriptor A returns<br>
<br>
 &lt;cd&gt;<br>
 &lt;price&gt;17.55&lt;/price&gt;<br>
  &lt;album&gt;Is This It&lt;/album&gt;<br>
  &lt;artist&gt;The Strokes&lt;/artist&gt; <br>
 &lt;/cd&gt;<br>
<br>
Descriptor B calls descriptor A and descriptor C (similar to A) and simply
copies them to the output stream. &nbsp;There are now 2 root nodes. &nbsp;As
previously mentioned put a tag around where the 2 descriptors are called.<br>
<br>
 
<h3>Can I see how other Descriptors work ? Can I get their source ?<br>
 </h3>
 Yes, since all descriptors have to be downloaded to be invoked they can
be downloaded with a web browser or other mechanism. &nbsp;The Descriptor
List tasks available from the <a
 href="file:///mnt/home/keith/work/mulgara/src/war/descriptor/">Descriptor Management</a> 
page allow you to list descriptors available on your host OR other hosts. 
&nbsp;The page while lists the descriptors includes a link to download the 
descriptor. &nbsp;<br>
 <b>NOTE</b> Some browsers have trouble displaying the descriptor so you
may have to download the link directly using a right mouse button click.<br>
 <br>
 <b>NOTE</b> Some links to local desciptor with file URLs such as file:/home/joe/work/helloworld.xsl 
will NOT work from some browsers, this is a security feature designed to stop
web pages accessing local files, you should retrieve the file using a local
file mananger such as Windows Explorer (and not Internet Explorer).<br>
 <br>

<h3>What is the 'Can not convert TREEFRAG into NodeSet' Error ?</h3>
 The Tree fragment must be converted into a Node set using a XALAN extension, 
see the next step. 
<h3>How do I apply the current stylesheets rules to XML returned from a query 
or another descriptor ?</h3>
 XSL does not directly allow for this, a XALAN extension must be used. &nbsp;The 
XML must be converted from a Tree fragment to a proper DOM Nodeset. &nbsp;To 
apply XML to the the style sheet use something like the following.<br>
  <span class="comment"><br>

<h3>How can I see the raw XML response from a Mulgara query ?</h3>
 Simply copy the result to the output stream like this:<br>
 <br>
 &lt;<span class="start-tag">xsl:variable</span><span
 class="attribute-name"> name</span>=<span class="attribute-value">"answer"</span>&gt;<br>
   
<blockquote>          &lt;<span class="start-tag">mulgaraDescriptor:query</span><span
 class="attribute-name"> model</span>=<span class="attribute-value">"{$model}" 
  </span><span class="attribute-name">node</span>=<span
 class="attribute-value">"{$node}"</span>&gt;<br>
    <span class="cdata">&lt;![CDATA[</span><br>
    <span class="cdata">            select $predicate from &lt;@@model@@&gt; 
where &lt;@@node@@&gt; $predicate $object;</span><br>
    <span class="cdata">            ]]&gt;</span><br>
  &lt;/<span class="end-tag">mulgaraDescriptor:query</span>&gt;<br>
  </blockquote>
                        &lt;/<span class="end-tag">xsl:variable</span>&gt;<br>
  <br>
            <span class="comment"></span><span class="comment">&lt;!-- Now 
apply the templates to the answer --&gt;</span><br>
            &lt;<span class="start-tag">xsl:copy-of</span><span
 class="attribute-name"> select</span>=<span class="attribute-value">"xalan:nodeset($answer)/*"</span><span
 class="attribute-name">/</span>&gt;<br>
 <br>
 If you are viewing the response in a browser the XML tags may not be visible, 
wrap them in xmp tags to see them i.e.<br>
 <br>
 <span class="comment">&lt;!-- Now apply the templates to the answer --&gt;</span><br>
 &lt;xmp&gt;<br>
 &lt;<span class="start-tag">xsl:copy-of</span><span
 class="attribute-name"> select</span>=<span class="attribute-value">"xalan:nodeset($answer)/*"</span><span
 class="attribute-name">/</span>&gt;<br>
 &lt;/xmp&gt; 
<h3>Why are some XSL parameters or variables written like $model and some 
like {$model} ?</h3>
 When refering to a parameter from an element in the XSL namespace it is
sufficent to refer to it using a $ prefix e.g.<br>
 <br>
 &lt;h1&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select="$title"/&gt;&lt;h1&gt;<br>
 <br>
 However when refering to parameters from any other namespace it must be
surrounded with curly braces {} e.g.<br>
 <br>
 &lt;xhtml:a href="{$homepage}"&gt;Home Page&lt;/xhtml:a&gt;<br>
 <br>
 and even when using no namespace:<br>
 <br>
 &lt;a href="{$homepage}"&gt;Home Page&lt;/a&gt; 
<h2>Common problems</h2>
 
<ul>
   <li>Forgetting to specify required descriptor parameters. &nbsp;</li>
   <li>Not specifying a source URL when calling a relative URL from a descriptor 
Element</li>
   <li>Changing parameter requirements and not redeploying.</li>
   <li>XML syntax problems - use a tool like xmllint</li>
   <li>XSL syntax problems - use a command line XSL processor</li>
   <li>redeploying built in descriptors and forgetting to redeploy other
descriptors<br>
   </li>
